# Pitopi

P2P mesh VPN powered by [iroh](https://iroh.computer). Connects peers by cryptographic identity (EndpointId), not IP address. Users create and join virtual networks with assigned IPs in the 100.64.0.0/10 (CGNAT) range.

## Build & Run

```bash
cargo -q build
cargo -q check
cargo -q test
cargo -q clippy
```

### Running

```bash
# Start the daemon (required first — owns TUN device and iroh endpoint)
sudo cargo -q run -- daemon

# In another terminal: create/join/manage networks (talks to daemon via IPC)
cargo -q run -- create                      # generates a three-word network name
cargo -q run -- join gentle-amber-fox       # join by three-word name via DHT lookup
cargo -q run -- leave gentle-amber-fox
cargo -q run -- nuke gentle-amber-fox       # publish empty membership + leave
cargo -q run -- status              # live peer info from daemon
cargo -q run -- down                # shut down the daemon

# ACL management (coordinator only, requires daemon running)
cargo -q run -- acl gentle-amber-fox tag servers ab3f d92c
cargo -q run -- acl gentle-amber-fox untag servers ab3f
cargo -q run -- acl gentle-amber-fox allow servers servers
cargo -q run -- acl gentle-amber-fox remove 0
cargo -q run -- acl gentle-amber-fox show
cargo -q run -- acl gentle-amber-fox apply   # re-publish current ACL to peers

# Standalone (daemon optional — queries daemon if running, falls back to saved config)
cargo -q run -- list                # show networks

# System service
sudo cargo -q run -- install-service
sudo cargo -q run -- uninstall-service

# Shell completions
cargo -q run -- completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/pitopi
```

Only `daemon` (and its alias `up`) requires `sudo`. All other commands run unprivileged via IPC.

### Cross-compile & deploy

```bash
just cross                   # build for x86_64 Linux
just deploy <ip>             # cross-build + install + create group + start daemon service
```

## Architecture

```
App (Minecraft, etc.) → TUN device (100.64.x.x) → pitopi → iroh QUIC datagrams → peer
```

### Modules

- `src/main.rs` — thin CLI client (clap), IPC client functions, `spawn_path_logger`, service install/uninstall; `pitopi create` (no --name, daemon generates name), `pitopi join <three-word-name>`, `pitopi nuke <name>`, `pitopi acl <network> tag/untag/allow/remove/show/apply` subcommands
- `src/daemon.rs` — daemon process: DaemonState (shared endpoint + TUN + PeerTable), NetworkHandle per active network, IPC server over Unix socket, coordinator accept loop, joiner mesh logic, reconnect loop, DHT publishers (membership + seed list + ACL), membership poller, three-word name generation, `nuke_network()`, `restore_coordinator_network()`, ACL state on NetworkHandle, IPC handlers for ACL commands, ACL fetch on join via `acl_dht_id` from Welcome, ACL load from file on startup, empty ACL publish on nuke

### Key flows

**Create (coordinator):** generates three-word name (adjective-noun-noun via `network_name::generate_name()`) → generates random `network_secret` ([u8; 32]) → derives `membership_signing_key` from coordinator secret key + network name → publishes directory record (name → network keys), seed list record (network secret → online peers), and membership record (coordinator key → blob hash) to pkarr → spawns DHT publishers and membership poller → listens for connections → on new peer: checks policy, checks IP collision, broadcasts MemberApproved to mesh, sends Welcome with member+approved lists+DHT IDs, promotes to member, broadcasts MemberSync with DHT IDs, notifies publishers.

**Join:** looks up three-word name via directory DHT → resolves seed list (network secret → online peer endpoints) and membership hash in parallel → fetches membership blob from any reachable seed peer via iroh-blobs → verifies blake3 hash → connects to coordinator or mesh peer → receives Welcome (member list + approved list) → joiner checks own IP for collision → creates TUN device → connects to each existing peer with MeshHello → spawns per-peer datagram readers → runs mesh forwarding loop.

**Nuke:** publishes empty membership record, empty seed list, and empty ACL record to pkarr (announcing the network is gone) → leaves the network (tears down connections, removes from config).

**ACL management:** Coordinator uses `pitopi acl` CLI commands (tag/untag/allow/remove/show/apply) to manage identity/tag-based allow rules. Changes are persisted to `~/.config/pitopi/acl/<network>.acl`, serialized as a canonical msgpack blob, hashed with blake3, published to pkarr (4th record type), and broadcast to all peers via `AclUpdated` control message. Peers fetch the blob, verify the hash, and enforce rules at the PeerTable routing layer. No rules = allow-all; any rules = deny-all except explicitly allowed traffic.

**Gatekeeper model:** coordinator approves identities and broadcasts MemberApproved. Any peer can then welcome an approved identity when it connects. The coordinator doesn't need to be online when the approved peer actually joins.

**DHT membership (four-record model):** Four pkarr record types enable coordinator-free joins and distributed ACL distribution:

1. **Directory record** (`derive_directory_key` from blake3 of network name): maps the human-readable three-word name → `{network_secret, membership_signing_key}`. Any peer can look up a network by name.

2. **Seed list record** (derived from `network_secret`): maps the network secret → list of online peer `EndpointId`s. Updated by `spawn_seed_list_publisher()` every 300s. Joiners use this to find online peers to fetch the membership blob from.

3. **Membership record** (derived from coordinator's secret key + network name via `blake3::derive_key`): stores a blake3 hash of canonical membership data (msgpack-serialized, sorted by identity). Joiners resolve the hash then fetch the full blob from any seed peer via iroh-blobs, verifying the hash before trusting the data.

4. **ACL record** (derived from coordinator's secret key + network name via `blake3::derive_key("pitopi/acl/...")`): stores a blake3 hash of canonical ACL data (msgpack-serialized). Peers fetch the full blob via iroh-blobs. Coordinator pushes `AclUpdated` to all peers on change — no polling needed.

`MembershipData` includes `network_secret` and `membership_signing_key` fields so all peers can republish seed list records. A background `spawn_membership_poller()` checks the membership hash every 60s and reconciles any changes (new members approved while a peer was offline).

**Reconnection:** per-peer reader detects connection drop → sends DisconnectEvent on mpsc channel → coordinator side removes dead peer from PeerTable (peers reconnect to it); joiner side removes dead peer and spawns reconnect task with exponential backoff (1s–30s) → on success, sends MeshHello, adds new connection to PeerTable, spawns fresh peer reader. Packets to the peer drop silently during the gap.

**Mesh forwarding:** TUN read loop extracts dest IP from IPv4 header bytes 16-19, looks up PeerTable, sends datagram on correct connection. Per-peer reader tasks write incoming datagrams to a shared TUN writer channel.

**Network isolation:** each network gets its own ALPN (`pitopi/net/<name>`). A single shared iroh Endpoint accepts connections for all networks, filtering by ALPN on accept. Single TUN device with /10 netmask shared across networks.

**Daemon/IPC:** `pitopi daemon` starts a long-lived root process that owns the iroh Endpoint, TUN device, and PeerTable. CLI commands (`create`, `join`, `leave`, `nuke`, `status`, `down`) connect via Unix socket IPC (`/var/run/pitopi/pitopi.sock`) using the same length-prefixed JSON wire format as `control.rs`. The daemon uses `Endpoint::set_alpns()` to dynamically add/remove network ALPNs at runtime. Each active network gets a `NetworkHandle` with a child `CancellationToken` for clean teardown on leave. `create` generates a three-word name automatically; `join` accepts a three-word name and resolves it via the directory DHT; `nuke` publishes empty records before leaving.

## Key Dependencies

- `iroh` — P2P QUIC transport with NAT traversal and relay fallback
- `iroh-blobs` — content-addressed blob transfer for membership and ACL data exchange (FsStore, BlobsProtocol)
- `iroh-dns` — pkarr `SignedPacket` for DHT membership records
- `blake3` — key derivation for per-network DHT signing keys, membership data hashing
- `rand` — random three-word network name generation (`network_name::generate_name()`)
- `tun` — cross-platform TUN device (macOS utun, Linux /dev/net/tun)
- `tokio` — async runtime
- `clap` + `clap_complete` — CLI parsing and shell completions
- `rmp-serde` — msgpack serialization for canonical membership and ACL data (compact, deterministic)
- `serde` + `serde_json` + `toml` — serialization for control messages and config
- `dirs` — platform config directory resolution

## Conventions

- Use `cargo -q` for all cargo commands
- Use `tracing` for logging (INFO level by default, configurable via `RUST_LOG` env var)
- ALPN per network: `pitopi/net/<name>` (e.g., `pitopi/net/gaming`)
- Virtual IPs: 100.64.0.0/10 CGNAT range — FNV-1a hash of identity, 22-bit host space
- TUN MTU: 1200 (fits within QUIC datagram limits)
- Identity persists to `~/.config/pitopi/secret_key` — same EndpointId across restarts
- Config persists to `~/.config/pitopi/networks.toml`
- ACL rules persist to `~/.config/pitopi/acl/<network>.acl` (text format: `tag <name> <peer-ids>` and `allow <src> -> <dst>` lines)
- macOS TUN requires destination address (point-to-point interface)
- Control messages: length-prefixed JSON (4-byte BE length + JSON body) over QUIC bidirectional streams
- Three-word names: adjective-noun-noun format (e.g., `gentle-amber-fox`), generated by `network_name::generate_name()` at create time; used as the human-friendly network identifier for joining via DHT lookup; replaces room codes entirely
- Use split/sink patterns for I/O — never share I/O resources (TUN, sockets, streams) behind a Mutex. Always split into separate read/write halves for concurrent access
- Avoid Mutex wherever possible — prefer channels (mpsc), split I/O, atomics, or RwLock (only for fast non-async state)
- Always update docs (CLAUDE.md, docs/book.md, README.md) after finishing a feature or significant change
