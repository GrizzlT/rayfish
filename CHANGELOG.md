# Changelog

All notable changes to Rayfish are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Release notes on `ray update`** — before swapping the binary (and in
  `ray update --check` when behind), print what the update brings: the stable
  channel walks every release in `(current, latest]` newest-first, while
  `--nightly`/`--version` show the resolved release's notes. Best-effort, so a
  fetch failure never blocks the update.
- **Standby control plane (`ray up`/`down`)** — `ray down` now takes only the
  data plane offline (TUN, routes, Magic DNS, inbound forward gate) while staying
  connected to peers, so the node keeps receiving roster/blob/firewall updates and
  `ray up` is near-instant with no re-dial. `sudo ray start`/`stop` remain the
  fully-offline switch.
- **Fail-fast firewall REJECT mode** — `ray firewall reject on|off` (opt-in,
  default off): a denied packet gets a TCP RST / ICMP-unreachable reply in both
  directions so the initiator fails immediately ("connection refused") instead of
  hanging. Off keeps the stealthy silent-drop posture.
- **`ray start` / `ray stop`** service commands to bring the whole daemon online
  or fully offline.
- **Comma-list firewall ports + short CLI aliases** — `--port`/`-P` takes a
  single port, a `start-end` range, or a comma list (`80,443`, `22,8000-9000`)
  expanded to one rule per item.
- **Control-plane abuse defense** — per-connection token-bucket rate limiting that
  closes sustained flooders, with a per-network debounced reconverge worker so a
  trigger burst coalesces into a single pkarr resolve + reconverge.

### Changed

- **Additive firewall suggestions** — each suggested token becomes one allow/deny
  rule with no synthesized catch-all (allow-list relies on the node's own inbound
  default-deny; denies-only = blacklist). `ray status` ends with a `pending`
  summary of things awaiting the user.

### Fixed

- Publish the contact record regardless of data-plane state, so `ray connect`
  resolves a peer that is on standby (`ray down`).

## [0.1.2]

### Changed

- **Magic DNS reworked to TUN interception** — `.ray` queries are intercepted in
  the TUN read loop and answered in-daemon via the magic IP `100.100.100.53`, so
  the resolver never binds the host's port 53. Non-`.ray` queries forward to the
  captured upstreams.
- **Direct-mode DNS takeover (Tailscale-style)** — on hosts without split-DNS,
  take over `/etc/resolv.conf` with an inotify re-assert loop that repairs it in
  ~ms when NetworkManager/dhclient overwrites it, plus a `dns=none` NM drop-in so
  NM stops regenerating it. Both are marker-guarded and crash-safe (panic hook +
  next-start cleanup restore the host's DNS).
- **Sharded, atomic per-network config** — globals in `settings.toml`, each
  network in `networks/<name>.toml`, all written via temp-file + atomic rename.
  Replaces the single `networks.toml` whose non-atomic rewrites raced and silently
  dropped networks; legacy files auto-migrate on first load.
- Retain only the 7 most recent daily log files.
- Authenticate GitHub API calls in `ray update` with a `gh` token (lifts the
  anonymous rate limit).

### Fixed

- Scope suggested firewall rules to non-joined networks correctly, and default a
  suggestion's peer to "any" so rules propagate instantly.
- Point systemd-resolved (`SetLinkDNS`) at the magic IP; fix the NetworkManager
  mode read on Linux.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- **Direct connections (`ray connect`)** — link two peers with no shared room id
  or invite via a rotatable, published **contact id**. `ray connect <contact-id>`
  sends a friend request; `ray connections [approve <id>]` reviews and admits it,
  minting a 2-peer network with the requester pre-approved. `ray contact
  [id|rotate]` prints or rotates the contact key.
- **Reusable invite keys** — `ray invite <net> --reusable [--expires]` mints a
  multi-use, expiring key that rides the signed `GroupBlob`, for unattended
  fleets (`ray join <key> --hostname H --auto-accept-firewall`). Revocation
  propagates via the blob.
- **Cross-coordinator invite gossip** — single-use invites are gossiped
  (`InviteShare`/`InviteUsed`) so any coordinator can validate and burn a
  cross-minted invite; combined with dial-fallback across the published
  coordinator set, fresh joins survive any single coordinator being offline.
- **Self-update (`ray update`)** — update from GitHub releases with SHA-256
  verification and atomic binary swap; `--check`, `--list`, `--force`,
  `--nightly` (rolling pre-release), and `--version V` (pinned, downgrades
  allowed). `ray version` / `--version` print the compiled version + git SHA.
- **Stable listen port** — the shared endpoint binds a fixed UDP port (41383) so
  it survives restarts and can be manually port-forwarded for guaranteed direct
  reachability, falling back to an ephemeral port if the port is in use.
- **CLI polish** — ANSI-aligned tables, progress spinners, an interactive
  `ray firewall pending` picker, and a global `--json` flag for machine-readable
  output.
- **Per-node firewall auto-accept** — `ray join --auto-accept-firewall` /
  `ray firewall auto-accept <net> on|off` to auto-install suggested rules.
- **IPv4 collision handling** — per-member `collision_index` with `assign_ip`
  rotation, index-aware validation, duplicate-IP rejection, and a deterministic
  reconverge tiebreak.
- **Opt-in QR invites** — `ray invite --qr` prints a scannable code.

### Changed

- **Secure-by-default inbound firewall** — unsolicited inbound TCP/UDP is now
  denied by default (inbound ICMP allowed, outbound allowed), with a stateful
  conntrack letting return traffic pass. `ray firewall default allow|deny` flips
  the inbound default.
- **Removed `trusted` networks** in favor of per-device, per-network firewall
  auto-accept; coordinators suggest rules on any network and nodes consent
  per-node (auto-accept or manual `ray firewall accept`/`deny`).
- **`ray apply` is YAML-only** (previously YAML/TOML/JSON), with each network
  mapping directly to its firewall subjects.
- **Mesh ALPN is versioned as the protocol-compatibility gate** — peers on
  different mesh versions share no common ALPN and can't connect. `ray join`
  pre-checks the coordinator's signed mesh version and dials surface an
  incompatible-version hint suggesting `ray update`.
- Roster and firewall state reconverge from the network-key-signed pkarr record,
  not from peer control messages (which are payload-free triggers).

### Fixed

- **ICMP conntrack** is now echo-type-aware, closing an inbound leak where reply
  packets could be treated as solicited.
- macOS routing — assert the IPv4 `100.64.0.0/10` route on activate, and install
  a loopback self-route so you can ping your own `*.ray` IP.
- Flush control-protocol QUIC streams and the pairing device-cert response so
  messages always reach the peer before the connection drops.
- `AdminGrant` keys are self-authenticated against the network public key.

### Performance

- Zero-copy TUN read and datagram forwarding path, with Criterion microbenchmarks
  (`benches/forward.rs`) over the per-packet data path.

## [0.1.0]

First public release.

### Added

- **P2P mesh VPN** over [iroh](https://iroh.computer) — peers connect by
  cryptographic identity (EndpointId), not IP. NAT traversal, hole-punching, and
  end-to-end encryption are handled by iroh, with encrypted relay fallback.
- **Dual-stack addressing** derived from identity: stable IPv4 in `100.64.0.0/10`
  (FNV-1a) and stable IPv6 in `200::/7` (blake3, 120-bit, never rotates).
- **Networks & access modes** — closed by default; `--open` for public networks.
  Closed networks admit via one-time **invite codes** (`ray invite`) or **live
  approval** (`ray requests` / `ray accept` / `ray deny`). The room id is a
  discovery key, never an admission credential.
- **Coordinator / membership model** — single signed `GroupBlob` per network
  published to a per-network pkarr record; gatekeeper admission, member roster,
  and `MemberApproved` broadcast so the coordinator need not be online for a
  member's later reconnects.
- **Co-coordinators** — `ray admin add` grants the network key over the
  authenticated mesh, enabling multiple machines to publish the signed blob.
- **Magic DNS** — reach peers at `name.network.ray` (A/AAAA/PTR/SOA), rebuilt
  from the roster on every membership change.
- **Per-device firewall** — directional, protocol-, port-, and network-scoped
  rules with a stateful conntrack; `firewall.toml`.
- **Trusted networks** — coordinators can suggest firewall rules that ride the
  signed blob; nodes auto-take (`--allow-trusted`) or queue them for manual
  `ray firewall accept` / `deny`.
- **Declarative provisioning** — `ray apply <spec>` reconciles trusted networks +
  suggested firewalls from a YAML/TOML/JSON spec, with `--prune`, `--dry-run`,
  `--invite-missing`, and `--example`.
- **Multi-device identity** — `ray pair` (ticket-based), plus encrypted
  backup/restore, including optional 1Password storage of the encrypted blob via
  the `op` CLI (`ray pair backup --1password` / `ray pair restore --1password`).
- **File sharing** — `ray send` / `ray files accept` over iroh-blobs.
- **mDNS local discovery** (`ray mdns on|off`, default on).
- **Service management** — `ray up`/`down`, `ray install`/`restart`/`uninstall`,
  and the Tailscale-style operator model (`ray set-operator`).
- **Audit log** — append-only peer connect/disconnect events at
  `~/.config/rayfish/audit.log`.
- **Diagnostics** — Prometheus metrics on `:9090`, rolling daily logs, and
  `ray report` to bundle logs + metrics + sanitized status.
- **Optional transports / export** — `--features tor` (Tor transport) and
  `--features otel` (OTLP span export).
